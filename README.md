## 📖 Overview

Lumos AI is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** based PDF assistant that enables users to upload one or multiple PDF documents and interact with them using natural language.

The application leverages **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash**, **LangChain**, **FAISS Vector Search**, and **semantic embeddings** to generate accurate, context-aware answers grounded only in the uploaded documents.

Whether you're reviewing research papers, resumes, reports, documentation, academic notes, or technical manuals, Lumos AI makes document understanding faster, smarter, and more interactive.

# 💻 How It Works

1. Upload one or multiple PDF documents.
2. Extract text from the uploaded PDFs.
3. Split the text into meaningful chunks.
4. Generate semantic embeddings for each chunk.
5. Store embeddings in a FAISS vector database.
6. Accept the user's natural language question.
7. Retrieve the most relevant document chunks.
8. Generate an accurate answer using Google Gemini 2.5 Flash.
